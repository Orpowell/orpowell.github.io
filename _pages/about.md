title: "About Me"
---

Hey! I’m Ollie. I am Biochemistry student at the University of East Anglia. Currently, I’m currently studying the molecular evolution of fungicide resistance in the [Brown](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/james-brown/) Group at the John Innes Centre for my Year in Industry. I’m also a board member for the [Bioinformatics Research Network](www.bio-net.dev)

## Research Interests
I enjoy combining wet-lab and computational methods to answer pressing biological questions and to develop [tools that benefit the scientific community](/software/). I have a particular interest in bioinformatics, synthetic biology and protein engineering.
