title: "About Me"

Hey! I’m Ollie. I am Biochemistry student at the University of East Anglia. Currently, I’m currently studying the molecular evolution of fungicide resistance in the [Brown Group](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/james-brown/) at the John Innes Centre for my Year in Industry.

## Research Interests
I enjoy combining wet-lab and computational methods to answer pressing biological questions and to develop [tools that benefit the scientific community](/software/). I have a particular interest in bioinformatics, synthetic biology and protein engineering.

## Contact Me

Please contact me at [hello@oliverpowell.com](mailto:hello@oliverpowell.com), if:
- You want to share an opportunity that might interest me such as a PhD (I am currently looking).
- You have an interesting project you would like to collaborate on.
