title: "About Me"
---

Hey! I’m Ollie, a Biochemistry student at the University of East Anglia. Currently, I’m studying the molecular evolution of fungicide resistance in the [Brown](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/james-brown/) Group at the John Innes Centre for my Year in Industry. I’m also a board member for the [Bioinformatics Research Network](bio-net.dev)

## Research Interests
I enjoy combining wet-lab and computational methods to answer pressing biological questions and develop [tools that benefit the scientific community](/software/). I’m particularly interested in bioinformatics, and synthetic biology and protein engineering.
