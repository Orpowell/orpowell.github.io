  title: AlphaFold Analyser Results
---

I have written several tools to aid the analysis and design of experiments for my research.
I'm committed to making these accessible, open-source and with high quality documentation, so
that they may be easily shared and used by the wider scientific community.

### Alphafold Analyser

A command line tool for analysing and assessing the quality of protein structures predicted 
using AlphaFold and AlphaFold Multimer. [Source code](https://github.com/Orpowell/alphafold-analyser/)

### CRISPR Designer

A tool for rapid design of sgRNAs and repair templates for CRISPR experiments using the protocol 
from “Crispr–cas9 genome engineering in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells” (Ryan et. al 2016). [Source code](https://github.com/Orpowell/CRISPR-designer/)

### AutoDock Vina Automator

A tool for performing molecular docking with AutoDock Vina for several individual ligands at once with technical replicates. [Source code](https://github.com/Orpowell/autodock-vina-automator)
